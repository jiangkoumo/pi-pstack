# Swarm

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
4. Pick the worker role from `/setup-pstack`: `pstack.poteto-agent` (code) for isolated writers, `pstack.verifier` (verification) for measurements, and `pstack.judgment-agent` (judgment) or `pstack.strongest-agent` (strongest) for exploration and model races. For a model race, name each arm’s configured model up front. Pick each subagent’s thinking for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one pi-subagents call: `subagent({workflow:"parallel",args:{tasks:[{agent:"pstack.poteto-agent",task:"<standalone brief for slice or race arm>"}]}})`. Expand the tasks array to include all N workers, each with its chosen registered role.

Pi uses local isolated worktrees or separate artifact paths; Cursor cloud placement and cloud base-branch fields are unavailable. Each brief names its starting branch and exact SHA; prepare that authorized isolated workspace before launch.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.

## Pi adaptation

Adapted from Lauren Tan’s pstack v0.15.25, MIT, fixed revision f713f14203cd6420cec13cd7c55c32d598dbab68. Read the [Pi adapter](../../adapters/pi/harness.md) for host mappings.

Delegation requires current operator or applicable project authorization and a compatible pi-subagents integration. If unavailable or unauthorized, perform authorized stages locally, disclose self-review and missing independence, and report any required independent stage as open. Use only registered pstack.* agents. Models and thinking bind through /setup-pstack roles and user agentOverrides; never put model in a task item or on the outer subagent call. Report unavailable or identical configured models; do not silently substitute. Await native completion notices and collect every required result before synthesis.

Use read for file contents, grep/find/ls for search and directories, and ffgrep/fffind when available. Batch independent reads with codemode when available. Use edit/write only for authorized changes; bash executes programs and Git in an explicit working directory, never reads or searches files. Keep one writer per worktree and isolate candidate output paths. Read-only reviewers never receive bash, edit, write, or nested delegation. Loading this skill grants no new permission: push, PR creation, merge, external messages, and destructive operations require explicit authorization in the current session. Commit only when authorized.
