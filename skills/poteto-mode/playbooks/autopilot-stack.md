### Autopilot-stack

Run the Autopilot-full playbook, but do not merge.

1. **In place of step 5, stop at verified.** Stop when each PR is verified and green at its current head, then hand the PRs to the operator. After the handoff, nobody pushes without the operator's go. Every loop tick prompt names this file, so each tick sees the no-merge rule.
2. **Stack a PR only when it builds on another PR.** This is the one exception to step 3. Base the PR on the other PR's branch in place of trunk, per **Size and stacks** in `playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`. In place of step 2's rebase onto trunk, each PR rebases onto its parent PR's branch, and the stack root rebases onto trunk. A new head on the lower PR restacks the PRs above it, and a PR whose `git patch-id` the restack leaves unchanged keeps its verdict.

**Reply:** list each PR with its verdict, in place of what merged.

#### Pi adaptation

Adapted from pstack by Lauren Tan, Copyright (c) 2026 Lauren Tan, MIT. Source: pinned upstream commit `f713f14203cd6420cec13cd7c55c32d598dbab68`; license: `LICENSES/pstack.txt` in the package root. The body above preserves the upstream steps with the listed Cursor tool, model, and skill substitutions. These notes govern platform and authorization differences.

Read [Poteto mode for Pi](../SKILL.md) before acting. Resolve skill names through `read <package>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `/skill:<name>`; load them on demand. `/unslop` replaces Cursor's deslop pass. Use Pi's `read`, `edit`, `write`, `ffgrep`/`grep`, `fffind`/`find`, and `ls` for file content; `bash` executes programs and checks. Ask the operator in plain text when a decision is needed.

Store local trails, patches, resume notes, and prototype artifacts under `<run-id>/` in the pstack run directory provided in the system prompt, or another durable operator-approved local directory. Keep evidence out of the repository unless its inclusion is authorized. A path in an upstream example is not permission to write unrelated user state.

The operator's current task grant governs delegation, local commits, and worktrees. Keep one writer per worktree; a replacement takes over only after the previous writer has stopped. Give every delegate the goal, allowed paths, prohibitions, approved decisions, acceptance commands, and a route back to its parent. Use configured role models and thinking from `/setup-pstack`; never put `model` on the outer `subagent` call or in a parallel task item. Wait for completion notices. If pi-subagents is unavailable or delegation is forbidden, execute the steps in sequence within the current grant, label self-review, and report `BLOCKED: independent review` where independent review is required.

Pushing, opening or editing a PR, and merging require explicit authorization in the current session for the action and scope. Auto-merge needs its own explicit grant. Rebase, amend, reset, force-push, and deletion follow the operator's Git and cleanup rules; an upstream imperative does not bypass them. Without push/PR authorization, prepare and display the proposed Conventional Commits title and PR body locally, then report the branch, checks, and pending action. Green CI, a loop tick, and a previous PR do not grant authority.

Run Autopilot-full's local-owner, parallel-call, evidence, and bounded-loop adaptations as well. Owner tasks use `pstack.poteto-agent` with the `code` role, and disjoint worktrees. Each owner writes only its own branch, including an authorized rebase onto its parent branch. Coordinate dependent restacks in order; never let the root and an owner write the same branch concurrently. Without remote PR or push authority, deliver the proposed local branches and dependency bases with a title and body for every PR. The operator retains landing authority, including any post-merge retarget.
