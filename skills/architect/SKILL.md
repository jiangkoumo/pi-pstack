# Architect

Sketch types, function signatures, class shapes, and module boundaries with `not implemented` bodies and pseudocode. Synthesize across multiple model perspectives, then fill in code against the chosen sketch.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before starting.

1. Ground
2. Sketch
3. Agree
4. Implement
5. Scrap

## Phase A: Ground the problem

Build a real mental model of every system the new code touches. Run the [how](../how/SKILL.md) skill over the relevant subsystems. Naming a file isn't grounding. Produce the architectural explanation `how` prescribes. If the design redefines ownership or layering, also run the [why](../why/SKILL.md) skill on the existing shape so the rationale becomes a constraint, not a guess.

Skip Phase A only when the work is genuinely greenfield with no surrounding system to integrate.

## Phase B: Sketch

Run the [arena](../arena/SKILL.md) skill with the design-sketch task and the Phase A grounding artifacts. Read and pass [runner-prompt.md](references/runner-prompt.md) as each runner's prompt.

Choose independent runners under the Pi execution and authority rules below. With no delegation authorization, design and compare the candidates sequentially.

Design it twice. Require at least two structurally distinct candidates before synthesis, even when the first looks sufficient. This is the **exhaust-the-design-space** principle skill made concrete. Whole-shape alternatives, not point fixes inside one shape.

Screen every candidate against [`references/design-red-flags.md`](references/design-red-flags.md) before synthesis. Assume the next contributor is an agent that sees only the files it opened, copies the nearest example, and takes the shortest path that compiles. Prefer the design where a change that looks right from one file is right for the whole repo.

Compare viable candidates on interface depth. Prefer the design that hides more complexity behind a smaller, simpler public surface. A rich interface can keep call chains short by concentrating capability instead of scattering it across layers.

Arena returns one synthesized design package. Its synthesis decision fills the rationale's "Synthesis decision" section.

## Phase C: Agree (opt-in)

For an authorized implementation task, proceed directly with the synthesized design. A design-only request ends with the design. No additional checkpoint is needed unless the operator requested one or a material requirement remains unresolved.

Opt in to a checkpoint when the invoker explicitly asks: "/architect with checkpoint," "stop and show me before implementing," or similar. Then surface the synthesized design and pause for sign-off.

When commits are authorized, the synthesis can ship as its own commit, as the "scaffold first" mode of the **foundational-thinking** principle skill. Planned and scoped breakage during fill-in is fine, per the **outcome-oriented-execution** principle skill. For adversarial pressure on the design before implementing, run the [interrogate](../interrogate/SKILL.md) skill on the synthesized sketch.

If the human pushes back on the shape (in a checkpoint or after the fact), treat that as Phase A evidence. Re-ground and re-run Phase B before writing more code.

## Phase D: Implement against the sketch

Replace `not implemented` bodies with code, pseudocode with logic. The synthesized sketch is the contract. Deviations from it are signal to surface, not friction to absorb silently. If a function needs a parameter the sketch didn't anticipate, ask whether the sketch was wrong, the requirement was missed, or the implementation is overreaching.

## Phase E: Scrap when the architecture is wrong

If implementation keeps producing friction the sketch can't absorb, throw the sketch out. Don't bolt fixes onto a wrong design, per the **redesign-from-first-principles** and **fix-root-causes** principle skills.

The signal is a *pattern*, not single instances. Tells:

- The same shape of workaround appearing repeatedly across unrelated code.
- Multiple unrelated edge cases that all need special-case branches.
- Types that need escape hatches (`any`, casts, optional fields always set in practice) to compile.
- The "we need a lock" reflex when the sketch said the state wasn't shared.
- Callers having to know the abstraction's internal rules to use it.
- Two or more independent Phase D deviations of the same shape across the implementation.

Use judgment. A few edge cases don't condemn an architecture. Some problems are legitimately complex. Complexity in the data is not complexity in the design.

When you scrap:

1. Re-run the **how** skill over what's been built.
2. Redesign as if the new constraints had been day-one assumptions, per redesign-from-first-principles.
3. Subtract before adding, per the **subtract-before-you-add** principle skill. The new sketch should be smaller than the old one before it grows.
4. Return to Phase B and re-run arena.

## Outputs

Store the design package under `<run-id>/` in the pstack run directory provided in the system prompt, or an operator-approved artifact directory. Do not assume a global home path.

The caller's usage is written first and the type sketch derived from it. One file with new types and signatures for small changes. Module map plus type definitions for larger work. The rationale ships alongside, shaped per [rationale-template.md](references/rationale-template.md), including the usage sketch and the synthesis decision.

## Pi execution and authority

Adapted from Lauren Tan’s pstack v0.15.25, MIT, fixed revision f713f14203cd6420cec13cd7c55c32d598dbab68. Read the [Pi adapter](../../adapters/pi/harness.md) for host mappings.

Delegation requires operator or applicable project authorization and an available pi-subagents integration. Otherwise perform the same stages sequentially and label the result self-review rather than independent review. Read the installed integration’s public instructions before launching. Use pstack.poteto-agent for isolated candidate writers and pstack.comment-sicko with its actual read-only allowlist for file reviewers. Keep one writer per directory. A source investigator may use only explicitly available read-only connectors; lack of connector access is a gap, never a reason to grant write tools.

Honor the operator’s configured roles and supported reasoning levels. Runtime-registered pstack agents bind their models through /setup-pstack: pstack.poteto-agent uses code, pstack.comment-sicko uses review, pstack.verifier uses verification, and pstack.prose-writer uses prose. This binding applies to direct calls and workflow children, including subagent({ workflow: "parallel", args: { tasks: [{ agent: "pstack.<agent>", task: "<brief>" }] } }). Do not put model in a task item or on the outer call; user subagents.agentOverrides may override the agent’s model and thinking. Do not invent per-skill configuration keys. Preserve model diversity where available; report when configured seats share a model. A rejected model stops that seat and is reported; never silently choose a fallback. Do not launch a child without authorization. Await native completion notices, not polling.

Use read for contents, ls for directories, fffind/ffgrep when available and find/grep otherwise. Use edit/write for authorized changes. Batch independent reads with codemode when available. Bash is for execution and Git with an explicit working directory, never a substitute file reader or searcher. Loading this skill grants no permission to commit, push, merge, deploy, delete, or send messages.
