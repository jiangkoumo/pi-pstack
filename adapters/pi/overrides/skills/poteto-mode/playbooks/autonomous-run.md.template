### Autonomous run

**You own the exit condition. Define done, then drive to it without stopping.**

1. State the exit condition as a checkable predicate before the first iteration (tests green, repro fixed, all N PRs merged, pixel-diff zero).
2. Pick the wake mechanism using pstack's `/loop` command. An event to watch (CI, a merge, a ref advancing) gets a watcher subagent that wakes you on the event, with a long time-based heartbeat as fallback. No event gets a fixed-interval heartbeat sized to when the result is worth re-checking. Pick each subagent's thinking level for the job, per the Subagents section.
3. Each iteration makes the smallest change the evidence justifies, verifies it against the predicate, commits if it advanced, discards changes that didn't help. Belt-and-suspenders that "might help" gets reverted, not left to ride.
   Sequence the work via the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, verifying each unit before the next instead of batching checks at the end.
4. Mid-run discoveries are yours. Address broken skills, related bugs, flaky verifiers, review noise, tooling failures, orphaned follow-ups, and fixable drift yourself via poteto-mode. Put out-of-band fixes in their own PR. Do not park reversible work for the human or ask a text question. Surface only irreversible actions, genuine product or preference calls no experiment can settle, or a real dead end. Keep the predicate as the main drive, and return to it after each side fix.
5. Checkpoint every iteration via the **show-me-your-work** skill, a row for what changed and whether the predicate moved.
6. Stop when the predicate is met. A plateau is not a stop, so keep going and pivot your approach to push past it. Surface a genuine dead end rather than spinning, and never relax the predicate to declare victory.

**Reply:** the exit condition, iterations run, what landed, what was discarded, final predicate state.

#### Pi adaptation

Adapted from pstack by Lauren Tan, Copyright (c) 2026 Lauren Tan, MIT. Source: pinned upstream commit `f713f14203cd6420cec13cd7c55c32d598dbab68`; license: `LICENSES/pstack.txt` in the package root. The body above preserves the upstream steps with the listed Cursor tool, model, and skill substitutions. These notes govern platform and authorization differences.

Read [Poteto mode for Pi](../SKILL.md) before acting. Resolve skill names through `read <package>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `/skill:<name>`; load them on demand. `/unslop` replaces Cursor's deslop pass. Use Pi's `read`, `edit`, `write`, `ffgrep`/`grep`, `fffind`/`find`, and `ls` for file content; `bash` executes programs and checks. Ask the operator in plain text when a decision is needed.

Store local trails, patches, resume notes, and prototype artifacts under `<run-id>/` in the pstack run directory provided in the system prompt, or another durable operator-approved local directory. Keep evidence out of the repository unless its inclusion is authorized. A path in an upstream example is not permission to write unrelated user state.

The operator's current task grant governs delegation, local commits, and worktrees. Keep one writer per worktree; a replacement takes over only after the previous writer has stopped. Give every delegate the goal, allowed paths, prohibitions, approved decisions, acceptance commands, and a route back to its parent. Use configured role models and thinking from `/setup-pstack`; never put `model` on the outer `subagent` call or in a parallel task item. Wait for completion notices. If pi-subagents is unavailable or delegation is forbidden, execute the steps in sequence within the current grant, label self-review, and report `BLOCKED: independent review` where independent review is required.

Pushing, opening or editing a PR, and merging require explicit authorization in the current session for the action and scope. Auto-merge needs its own explicit grant. Rebase, amend, reset, force-push, and deletion follow the operator's Git and cleanup rules; an upstream imperative does not bypass them. Without push/PR authorization, prepare and display the proposed Conventional Commits title and PR body locally, then report the branch, checks, and pending action. Green CI, a loop tick, and a previous PR do not grant authority.

Use the implemented pstack command `/loop run --max-turns <n> --until "<predicate command>" --until-timeout <seconds> "<goal>"`. The predicate returns 0 only when the goal is met. Inspect with `/loop status` and stop with `/loop stop`. This runtime continues bounded turns; it does not provide Cursor's interval scheduler. An event watcher uses the read-only `pstack.verifier` on the `verification` role and native completion events. If a timed watcher is unavailable, recheck manually within the remaining budget. Budget exhaustion, a failed predicate launch, an operator stop, or a genuine dead end leaves an explicit unfinished result. Do not relax the predicate.

Side fixes stay within the current grant; record other findings and request the missing scope in plain text only when needed. Preserve the upstream checkpoint discipline with the implemented show-me-your-work skill. Out-of-band PRs, iteration commits, and discarded changes follow the actual Git grant and preserve other writers' work. No PR or automatic merge occurs without current-session permission.
