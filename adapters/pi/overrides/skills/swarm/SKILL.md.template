# Swarm

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
4. Pick available configured worker models under the Pi rules below. For a model race, name every arm’s exact model up front.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

With delegation authorized, launch workers through the installed integration and isolate every writer. There is no implied cloud execution. A worker that needs a particular base names the exact local commit; do not push a branch to make it available without authorization. Otherwise execute slices sequentially and disclose the missing parallel coverage.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and, when authorized, respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.

## Pi execution and authority

Adapted from Lauren Tan’s pstack v0.15.25, MIT, fixed revision f713f14203cd6420cec13cd7c55c32d598dbab68. Read the [Pi adapter](../../adapters/pi/harness.md) for host mappings.

Delegation requires operator or applicable project authorization and an available pi-subagents integration. Otherwise perform the same stages sequentially and label the result self-review rather than independent review. Read the installed integration’s public instructions before launching. Use pstack.poteto-agent for isolated candidate writers and pstack.comment-sicko with its actual read-only allowlist for file reviewers. Keep one writer per directory. A source investigator may use only explicitly available read-only connectors; lack of connector access is a gap, never a reason to grant write tools.

Use exact available provider/model IDs and supported reasoning levels, honoring the operator’s configured roles. Automatic role routing is supported only for the current direct-call path. The installed parallel workflow forbids model in tasks/chain items, and script-internal launches have no public launch hook for this mapping. Do not claim automatic per-seat role routing or put model into those items. When exact per-seat models matter, use only a supported direct-call route after checking its schema, or report the unavailable route; an explicit design method is not dispatch evidence. Do not invent per-skill configuration keys. Preserve model diversity where available. A rejected model stops that seat and is reported; never silently choose a fallback. Do not launch a child without authorization. Await native completion notices, not polling.

Use read for contents, ls for directories, fffind/ffgrep when available and find/grep otherwise. Use edit/write for authorized changes. Batch independent reads with codemode when available. Bash is for execution and Git with an explicit working directory, never a substitute file reader or searcher. Loading this skill grants no permission to commit, push, merge, deploy, delete, or send messages.
