# Interrogate

Spawn one reviewer per configured model to adversarially review code changes. The adversarial signal comes from model diversity, not assigned personas. The deliverable is a synthesized verdict. Do NOT auto-apply changes. This skill returns a verdict; an implementation request must separately authorize applying fixes.

## Step 1, Scope

Identify what to review from context:

- If the user points at specific files or a diff, use that.
- If on a feature branch, run `git diff main...HEAD` (or the appropriate base branch) for the full changeset.
- If the user's message references recent work, gather the relevant files.

Package the diff or file contents with any surrounding context files the reviewers need to understand the code.

## Step 2, Intent

Before spawning reviewers, state the intent in one clear paragraph from the user's message, commit messages, the PR description if one exists, and the code. If you're unsure about the intent, ask the user before proceeding.

## Step 3, Spawn Reviewers

With delegation authorized, launch independent read-only reviewers through the installed integration, labeled Reviewer A, B, and so on. Give each the same complete prompt. Diverse available models provide adversarial signal; do not assign different personas or different coverage to seats. With no delegation, review sequentially and disclose self-review.

Read [reviewer-prompt.md](references/reviewer-prompt.md) and fill in the same template for every reviewer with the stated intent, the diff or file contents, the rubric from [rubric.md](references/rubric.md), and the code-quality lens from [code-quality-review.md](references/code-quality-review.md). Use supported model settings under the Pi rules below.

## Step 4, Synthesize

As results come back, build a unified picture. Parse every reviewer's findings. Merge findings that describe the same issue differently, and note which models raised each one. Findings two or more models raised independently are the highest signal. Read a lone model's finding, but weight it accordingly. Note disagreements. If one model flags something and another explicitly says the opposite, that is context for the verdict.

## Step 5, Lead Judgment

You are the lead reviewer, a pragmatic senior engineer, not a neutral aggregator. Read [lead-judgment.md](references/lead-judgment.md) for the full framework. Put every finding in one of four buckets, with the model(s) that raised it and a one-line rationale.

- **Act on**. Real issues affecting correctness, security, or maintainability given the actual goals. They would block a real PR.
- **Consider**. Legitimate, but you're not sure they outweigh the cost of addressing them now. Worth the user's attention.
- **Noted**. Technically valid but not actionable. Context-dependent, premature optimization, or low-impact at this stage.
- **Dismissed**. Wrong, nitpicky, or missing context, with a brief reason.

## Output Format

### Intent
> [The stated intent paragraph from Step 2]

### Reviewers
- Reviewer [label]: [model name], [N findings] (one bullet per reviewer)

### Act On
[Each: description, which models raised it, why it matters.]

### Consider
[Each: description, which models raised it, the tradeoff.]

### Noted
[Brief list.]

### Dismissed
[Each with a brief rationale.]

### Agreement Map
[Where models agreed and diverged, and what that pattern tells us.]

## Pi execution and authority

Adapted from Lauren Tan’s pstack v0.15.25, MIT, fixed revision f713f14203cd6420cec13cd7c55c32d598dbab68. Read the [Pi adapter](../../adapters/pi/harness.md) for host mappings.

Delegation requires operator or applicable project authorization and an available pi-subagents integration. Otherwise perform the same stages sequentially and label the result self-review rather than independent review. Read the installed integration’s public instructions before launching. Use pstack.poteto-agent for isolated candidate writers and pstack.comment-sicko with its actual read-only allowlist for file reviewers. Keep one writer per directory. A source investigator may use only explicitly available read-only connectors; lack of connector access is a gap, never a reason to grant write tools.

Use exact available provider/model IDs and supported reasoning levels, honoring the operator’s configured roles. Current direct-call code/review mapping does not prove workflow role routing; the parent must resolve and verify each seat against the installed integration. Do not invent per-skill configuration keys. Preserve model diversity where available. A rejected model stops that seat and is reported; never silently choose a fallback. Do not launch a child without authorization. Await native completion notices, not polling.

Use read for contents, ls for directories, fffind/ffgrep when available and find/grep otherwise. Use edit/write for authorized changes. Batch independent reads with codemode when available. Bash is for execution and Git with an explicit working directory, never a substitute file reader or searcher. Loading this skill grants no permission to commit, push, merge, deploy, delete, or send messages.
